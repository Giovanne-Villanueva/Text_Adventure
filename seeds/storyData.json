The gaint trees make it hard to navigate through the forest. Looking at the map again you see that the green man left you another note about the key in the forest. The note says: \" In the forest the key you are looking for is guarded by a cube monster. There are many cubes but the biggest one is the one with the key.\". After searching for some time you find a hovering cube off in the distance."

The rock is leading you towards the edge of the forest close to a desert nearby."

    "tale": "Wheezy Goose wakes up under a tree, rain drizzling onto his bill, his head pounding from honking all night at the pond, and the ground feels like its rumbling as the blood sloshes back and forth in his head. No, that's not his head, but wheels turning over the stone road toward where he lies blinking up into the light filtering down through the leaves. As the vehicle closes into view, its driver turns his short, human neck, then quickly twists up his countenance, and glares down his nose at Wheezy Goose as if Wheezy was nothing but a common gutter bird, a cooped-up, wing-clipped, honk-aholic. What should Wheezy do?"
  },
  {
    "tale": "The vehicle speeds off…leaving Wheezy with nothing to do but tramp down the road, and so he tramps, honking and shifting his wings, rock-waddling on his dark webbed feet. Why is Wheezy such a miser, bemuses Wheezy Goose. It may be because Wheezy Goose believes all geese look like disgraced aristocrats condemned to parade through a never-ending shanty town. There are only haves, and have-nots, thinks Wheezy. And I know which I am. The thought strikes a match in his veins, ignites, but the sight of a column of smoke in the distance spuming from what appears, as Wheezy squints his black eyes, a rather lux inn and eatery. GOOSE-BERRIES…” Maybe, I'm not no have-not today,” ponders Wheezy"
  },
  {
    "tale":"Wheezy runs into the dark wood behind him, the bramble of branches thickening as he descends further into the wilderness. He should have flown away, he regrets, but it's too late now, and always hunters wait to shoot down a goose for dinner. He lumps his fear back into his throat, and while his neck curls scanning for a spot of light to appear in the tree canopy, he trips, slamming his beak into the muddy morass of his own cowardice. "
  },
  {
    "tale": "The traveler tries to thwart old Wheezy but Wheezy is fast and slippery and knows a thing or two about ransacking—he's done it hundreds of times after all. When Wheezy lifts the tarp off the vehicle's trunk with his bill, he finds a few loose eggs knocking against each other in a pail. Knowing this traveler is a no-good rotten egg snatcher, Wheezy metes out some avian justice, flaps his goose wings, rises, dips back down. Whack, bonk, and a honk—the last for good measure. The egg-snatcher flops unconscious over the side of the vehicle, and an apple rolls out of his sleeve, drops, and bounces toward Wheezy Goose who stops it cold with a leathery webbed foot. Wheezy takes a bite out of the apple and feels as though air is passing under his wings. Wheezy gets + 10 hp from the apple, must be golden. But the feeling of wind-in-feathers is interrupted by three foxes sauntering out of the woods, wearing socks over their heads as bandit masks with little eye and mouth holes cut out of them. The one wearing a tight fitted argyle sock, clearly the leader, coolly says, \"that there is my apple.\" The other two cackle: \"Yeah. Yeah. Our apple.\" \"My apple,\" retorts the leader. \"Scavengers,\" says Wheezy dryly. \"I'll never.\" The leader spits in the dirt, some gooping around the sock's mouth hole, and says, \"It's a barnyard brawl, then\". \nWhat should Wheezy do? "
  },
  {
    "tale":"The traveler grinds to a halt. The air is as still as the moment between heaves of a storm. The traveler throws his head back as if readying to spit at Wheezy, but he lets out a laugh—all verve and jugular. \"Greetings, my fine feathered friend.\" replies the traveler. \"What brings a goose this far North this late into the fall? A bit odd for your kind, isn't it?\" A bit odd indeed, murmurs Wheezy, so the traveler doesn't hear. The traveler gestures to Wheezy, asks: \"need a ride?\"\nWhat should Wheezy do? "
  },
  {
    "tale": "Wheezy opens the door to the inn. The interior belies the inviting exterior. It's barren and drab inside, save a preponderance of thickly roped spiderwebs hanging like frayed curtains and over-wrought chandeliers from the ceiling and support beams. The whole place might very well be held together entirely by the spiderwebs. A fire flickering in the hearth provides the only spot of warmth…of a certain warmth, anyway, and there is a plush chair beside it—empty. Wheezy steps further in, the wind sucking the door shut behind him. “Hello?” honks Wheezy. Nothing.\n Long been on the road Wheezy has, thinks Wheezy Goose, in the elements. He makes his way over to the chair and plops down folding in his appendages until he resembles nothing more than an ashy, burnt bread loaf. As he blinks away the fire to rest and sleep, a strange rubbing sound, like ropes being pulled over a rail, almost in timed rhythm. Wheezy eyes search around for the source of the sound, keeping the rest of his body still. The webs are moving and hoisting all around him, weaving and heaving the beams of the house like vines strangling a tree. The webs squeezing the house's walls closer together.\n"

    "tale": "Wheezy, being a suspicious goose, continues onward to see where the road ahead of him leads. After 2 to 3 goose-minutes (see appendix for conversion of goose-minutes to human-minutes) Wheezy begins feeling like he is getting bigger. He lifts a wing up to inspect, then looks down and inspects his feet. He's not getting bigger; the road is getting narrower and narrower, and the trees edging the road are getting closer and closer. He waddles forward a bit more. Yes, the world is constricting around him.\nWhat should Wheezy do?"
